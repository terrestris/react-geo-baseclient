## [2.0.0] - 2021-07-20

### Breaking changes

- `GetFeatureInfo` components refactoring ([#810](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo-baseclient/pull/811))
  - Refactored all `GetFeatureInfo` related components to react's functional component
  - ðŸš¨ Replaced `width` property set on GetFeatureInfo overlay menu by `maxWidth` (increased from 200 to 350px) to prevent cropped titles on long layer names
- `HSIButton` component refactoring ([#817](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo-baseclient/pull/817))
  - ðŸš¨ `t` was removed from class props
  - ðŸš¨ `dispatch` was removed from class props, react-redux hook will be used instead
  - ðŸš¨ default value for `tooltip` is set to `Feature Info`
  - ðŸš¨ default value for `tooltipPlacement` is set to `right`
  - added additional optional propery `onToggleCb` enabling custom logic on HSIButton activation (e.g. show notification about tool state, queryable layers etc.)
- Introduce `"Zoom to layer resolution"` context menu entry ([#809](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo-baseclient/pull/809))
  - Add configurable layer context menu entry "Zoom to layer resolution" (default is false)
  - ðŸš¨ Default value of `showZoomToLayerExtent` and `showApplyTimeInterval` configs was changed to `false`. So from now, the configs must be explicitily provided by component instantiation if the context menu entries should be shown in client.

### Added

### Changed

- Set `shogunId` property on all parsed layers in the `ShogunBootAppContextUtil` ([#804](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo-baseclient/pull/804)).
- Extract `Permalink` panel to an own component ([#806](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo-baseclient/pull/806)).
- Pass all existing button props to `HsiButton`([#813](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo-baseclient/pull/813)).

### Fixed

- Reenable hover/pressed button color ([#805](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo-baseclient/pull/805)).
- Use `text-overflow:ellipsis` to avoid cropped permalink links ([#808](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo-baseclient/pull/808)).
